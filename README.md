# ðŸ’» Workstation autosetup
Automatic setup script for my linux workstations 

> [!WARNING]
Please, remember that my base system and preferences may not match with yours. The setup script and the chosen packages are set for an Arch Linux based installation that work for me.

## ðŸš€ Run
```console
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilpe/workstation-autosetup/main/setup.sh)
```
#### Alternative:
If something doesn't suits you, clone the whole repo 
```console
git clone https://github.com/gilpe/workstation-autosetup.git
```
and after doing your tweaking, run this
```console
cd workstation-autosetup && chmod u+x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
